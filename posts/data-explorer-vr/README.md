# RNA data explorer - VR

This application was built as a demo during the 2015 Wyss Retreat. It demonstrates a fun and intuitive way of viewing 3D sequencing data.

This project is meant to be viewed using [Google Cardboard](https://vr.google.com/cardboard/). Although it may work in the browser, the controls are very unintuitive.
